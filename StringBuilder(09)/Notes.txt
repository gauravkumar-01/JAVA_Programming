STRING BUILDER IN JAVA :

String Builder is a predefined class in Java.

During the Addition of any string,charachter..
    -> In String a new String is created at another memory location,
    -> But in StringBuilder the character or String is added at the smae memory location.

Note : StringBuilder can append any type of value, It may be character, may be strin, may be Integer, may boolean etc..

Initially, the StringBuilder has the some amount of capacity, after the completely filling this capacity, its size will increase.
It's capacity increases by : 2*(previous_length+1)

// Declaring the StringBuilder..
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

IMPORTANT : We can check its capacity by using sb.capacity() method
        -> It's default capacity is 16.
        -> Values can be added in it, by using sb.append() method.

        // To check the length of StringBuilder
            sb.length() method is used..
        
        // To reverse the value
            sb.reverse() method will be used..

        // To convert this StringBuilder datatype into String
            sb.toString() method.

        // We can get the substring of StringBuilder
            sb.substring(start,end);

IMPORTANT NOTE : All the tasks that can be done by String, these all tasks can also be done by using StringBuilder.
