Function calling itself with smaller subproblem and having a base condition..

A recursive function must have the following 3 steps :
    --> Base Case
    --> Function Calling (with smaller sub-problem)
    --> Answer Calculation/Printing


If last statement of the function is recursive call then it is "tail recursion".

If last statement is not a recursive call or any operation is being performed then it is "Head Recursion".

Recursive function se aane ke bad agr koi bhi operation perform ho rha hai to ye Head Recursion hai.....
